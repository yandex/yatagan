# Dagger Lite

## Summary

Dagger 2 API implementation (with slight changes) with addition of Dynamic conditions API and Component Variant system.
Tuned for build and component initialization performance.

Supports multiple backends first class:

- APT/KAPT
- KSP (experimental, unstable due to KSP utter inconvenience to use for Java code generation)
- Reflection (experimental)

## Differences from vanilla Dagger2 in core API

[Base developer guide][base-doc] for Dagger2 is a good start, as dagger-lite philosophy and API was based on it.

----------------
Other behavioral changes: 

- Declaring subcomponents now only works explicitly via `Module.subcomponents` list. 
Implicit bindings for subcomponent factory, when declaring entry-point of its type in a parent component, 
are not supported.

- Automatic factory/builder generation is not supported - an explicit one must be written if required.

- `@IntoList` bindings contributions are not inherited from parent component.
Clients will get "duplicate bindings" error instead.

- Generated components are not named `Dagger<component-name>`; the names are mangled, and the access should be made via
`Dagger.builder()`/`Dagger.create()` invocations. This is made to support reflection backend.
